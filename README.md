```

### About This Template  

This template is built on top of the popular `create-t3-app`. However, after initializing a new project, I often found myself repeatedly setting up the same configurations—like API calls for the client, app context, Google authentication, and more. To streamline my workflow, I created this template primarily for personal use, but if you use the following technologies, you might find it useful too:  

- **Next.js**  
- **tRPC**  
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **Next.js**  
- **Lucid Icons**  
- **Framer Motion**  
- **Prisma**  
- **PostgreSQL**  
- **TypeScript**  
- **NextAuth.js** (Google Authentication)  

⚠ **Disclaimer:** Use this template at your own risk.
